### How I solved this
- Created variables
  - a vector `solution` of type int with the elements of nums
  - a stack `stk` of type int
- So here my logic is to iterate through the array twice and use `%` to make it seem like im doing it circularly
- Maintain `stk` to be monotonically decreasing
  - while `stk` is not empty and its top is less than `nums[i%nums.size()]`
    - pop `stk`
  - at the end if `stk` is empty, `solution[i%nums.size()] = -1`
  - else set it to the top of `stk`
  - push `nums[i%nums.size()]` to `stk`
- return `solution`
- Took me ~15 mins, ill revisit, pretty interesting
